**Home Medicines Review (HMR)**

A program funded by the Australian Government Department of Health & Ageing under the 6th Community Pharmacy agreement. The HMR program aims to increase quality use of medicines and reduce adverse medicine events by conducting a comprehensive review of a patient’s medicine in the patient’s home.

**Patient Eligibility**

A GP determines if a patient is eligible for a HMR. Eligibility includes:
▪	Takes more than 12 doses of a medicine per day;
▪	Have difficulty managing their own medications because of illiteracy or language barriers or impaired sight;
▪	Attend a number of different doctors, both GPs and specialists;
▪	Have been discharged from hospital in the previous four weeks;
▪	Have had a significant change to their medication regimen in the past three months
▪	Have experienced a change in their medical condition or abilities – e.g. falls, cognition, physical function;
▪	Use prescription medicine with a narrow therapeutic index or medicine that needs therapeutic monitoring;
▪	Have symptoms of an adverse drug reaction;
▪	Have a sub-therapeutic response to therapy;
▪	Have problems managing medication devices, e.g. DAAs(Dose Administration Aids);
▪	Are at risk or cannot manage their medication due to changes in dexterity, confusion or impaired vision;

**Cost of HMRs**

No cost to the patient nor the medical practice. 

**Financial Benefits for Your Practice Through Patient Referrals**
GPs are able to claim for a fully completed MBS Item 900. As an example of revenue growth over a 12-month period, 5 HMR referrals per week will generate around $47,000 in additional income for the referring GP.
